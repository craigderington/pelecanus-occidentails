### üõ°Ô∏è n8n Workflow Backup Repository

This repo is a dedicated vault for backing up and organizing n8n workflows, ensuring your automation masterpieces are safe, versioned, and ready to deploy. Built for n8n, the open-source automation platform, this repo focuses on preserving your workflows for data syncs, API integrations, and AI-driven tasks.

üéØ Purpose
This repo backs up my personal n8n workflows, including:

- Data Syncs: Automating data transfers between Google Sheets, Airtable, and CRMs like HubSpot.

- API Integrations: Connecting tools like Slack, Trello, and custom APIs for seamless workflows.

- AI Workflows: Using LLMs (e.g., OpenAI) for content generation and data enrichment.

No Python scripts or dependencies are included‚Äîpure n8n JSON workflows and documentation.


üìÇ What's Inside?

/workflows: Stores .json workflow files, named clearly (e.g., sheets_to_hubspot_sync.json, slack_notification.json).

/docs: Markdown files detailing each workflow‚Äôs purpose, setup, and credentials needed.

üöÄ Getting Started with n8n

#### Option 1: Run n8n Locally

Install Docker (if not already installed):
Docker Installation Guide

Run n8n:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 5678:5678 n8nio/n8n
```

Open http://localhost:5678 in your browser to access the n8n Editor UI.


#### Import workflows:
Clone this repo:git clone https://github.com/craigderington/n8n-workflows.git

In n8n UI, go to Menu (‚ò∞) ‚Üí Import Workflow.

Select a .json file from /workflows.

Configure credentials and activate.

#### Option 2: Use n8n Cloud

Sign up at n8n.io for a cloud instance.

Clone this repo:git clone https://github.com/craigderington/n8n-workflows.git

In the n8n Cloud UI, import workflows from /workflows as described above.
Set up credentials for your connected apps.

üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

Test Workflows: Validate in a sandbox environment before production.
Secure Credentials: Store API keys securely in n8n‚Äôs credential manager.
Regular Backups: Manually export workflows from n8n UI and commit to this repo.
Sanitize Inputs: For AI workflows, prevent prompt injection by validating inputs.
